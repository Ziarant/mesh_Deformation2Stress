>  Calculate stress based on the mesh before and after deformation.

## Description
The program extracts the displacement field based on the source mesh and the target mesh before and after deformation, and calculates the stress distribution. The code was written in <b>python</b> primarily to be easy to read and rapid development, so it did not play with full computational efficiency. A later version (V2) is planned to optimize the core code by using C++.
